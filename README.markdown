#PhotoImporter
PhotoImporter provides a simple way to import a large number of photos into the iPad's Camera Roll, without using iPhoto. Just add the photos to PhotoImporter via File Sharing in iTunes, then open the app and tap "Boom".

This application is intended for developers as a quick utility, not as a production application, hence why I'm not releasing it on the App Store (I also doubt there's a market for it). If you intend to publish it, please credit me, and make it free.
